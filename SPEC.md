# Container Native Registry Specification

## Overview

TODO(jzelinskie): finish this section

"Container Native Registry" (CNR) is a specification describing how containerized applications' configurations can be discovered and distributed in a portable way.
The specification defines a common API that can be used to unify an ecosystem of tools experimenting with the the creation and deployment of applications.

The core goals of the specification include:

* Designing an API that remains agnostic to the format of the artifacts being stored in the registry.
* Reusing as much of the work pioneered by the [Open Container Initiative Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) as possible.

### Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this and other documents of the specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
